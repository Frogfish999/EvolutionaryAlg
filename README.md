# EvolutionaryAlg
This project is an exploration of genetic algorithms and applications in data fitting. 
The project is currently interacted with through a command line program called FunctionBuilder. This program allows you to create and interact with MutableFunct objects which are tree-like representations of mathmatical expressions.
