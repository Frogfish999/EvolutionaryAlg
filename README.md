# EvolutionaryAlg
This project is an exploration of genetic algorithms and applications in data fitting. 
The project is currently interacted with through a command line program called FunctionBuilder. This program allows you to create and interact with MutableFunct objects which are tree-like representations of mathmatical expressions.
TIP: Use a very large number of subjects for efficient training (I default to 1000 subjects)
Log:
x+10 and 10y + 2x successfully trained
General mutablefuncs objects can be fit

Fibonnaci with linear interpolation fit with range 0,25, higher causes overflow type stuff and constants appear
	result -> about 1.5 ^ a (Image shows green ->fibonnacci, red -> 1.5^a)
